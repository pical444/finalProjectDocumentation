        Introduction

    <p>
        This is a random poetry generator connected to a potentiometer through Arduino made from a letter I did to an ex lover that synthesizes all the pain and anxiety I have been feeling for the last couple of months.

        Concept and background research
    </h1>
    <p>
        The project starts as a catarsis from and for myself and the emotions I have carried out on this journey Ive had with my inner consciousness and the detachment of past connections in order to form a new connection with myself throughout the past six months I have been living in a foreign country for the first time. Since I have been struggling with deep emotions, they were my strongest inspiration throughout the project: living, understanding and getting them out of my system was the motor for which I wanted to start this assignment in the first place. The idea began with a scan I made from an envelope filled with poems and flowers and covered in with my own hair in the shape of a heart that I took while I was on one of the depressive episodes Iâ€™ve had within the last couple of months. I was not inspired to create (or less begin with my final submissions) throughout the time that just went by but making this set of scans made me think of a way in which I could implement this same concept and adapt it to a computational form, although in the end it did not had the result I wanted since I did not had the time I needed to align the physical object with the code itself. 
As a matter of inspiration I used my own emotions from re-discovering myself inside this new space that Im occupying, as well as the learnings I have from the past seven months coursing the Masters, in addition to the words that have always surrounded my life as a poet. Even though it is not the most advanced project, I wanted to experiment linking both one of my practices (wiriting) with the technical implementations I have learned throughout the course in order to obtain a poetic and trascendental outcome, especially for myself.
