        This is a random poetry generator connected to a potentiometer through Arduino made from a letter I did to an ex lover that synthesizes all the pain and anxiety I have been feeling for the last couple of months.

    <h2>
        Concept and background research
    </h2>
    <p>
        The project starts as a catarsis from and for myself and the emotions I have carried out on this journey Ive had with my inner consciousness and the detachment of past connections in order to form a new connection with myself throughout the past six months I have been living in a foreign country for the first time. Since I have been struggling with deep emotions, they were my strongest inspiration throughout the project: living, understanding and getting them out of my system was the motor for which I wanted to start this assignment in the first place. The idea began with a scan I made from an envelope filled with poems and flowers and covered in with my own hair in the shape of a heart that I took while I was on one of the depressive episodes I’ve had within the last couple of months. I was not inspired to create (or less begin with my final submissions) throughout the time that just went by but making this set of scans made me think of a way in which I could implement this same concept and adapt it to a computational form, although in the end it did not had the result I wanted since I did not had the time I needed to align the physical object with the code itself. 
As a matter of inspiration I used my own emotions from re-discovering myself inside this new space that Im occupying, as well as the learnings I have from the past seven months coursing the Masters, in addition to the words that have always surrounded my life as a poet. Even though it is not the most advanced project, I wanted to experiment linking both one of my practices (wiriting) with the technical implementations I have learned throughout the course in order to obtain a poetic and trascendental outcome, especially for myself.

    <h2>
        Technical Implementation
    </h2>
    <p>
        At first the project was devised to make a communication between TouchOsc and Visual Studio Code in order to generate a drawing with the frequency capturated through Protokol but the idea did not took place due to the emotional place where I have been for the last couple of months so I decided that I was going to develop a more personal project in order to find the motivation within myself to carry it out. The initial idea was to have a string of hair which had inside an stretch sensor connected to Arduino that communicated with the sketch in NodeJs, as if the hair was the one “pulling the strings” of the random poetry generator for it to create a new poem based on the sentence structure of the main poem written around the new one. This idea could not be taken into place so I decided to control the sketch through a potentiometer object so I could integrate both physical and computational forms in order for the project to reference the knowledge I have obtained within the MA course. 
The decision to diagram the screen as I did was made since I wanted for the outcome to look oversaturated in words as if you were reading a thousand poem. At the end, I thought as a good idea to leave only the parts of the sentences of my poem (verbs, nouns, connectors, etc) to deliver a metaphor within the project that has to do with the nonsense relationships may carry out at the end of them: no matter how many promises or declarations of love you have made throughout it, the majority of romantic relationships (or at least in my case) always end making no sense because of the longing for a moment or emotions that are not there anymore, since everything changes and people may take another course. This is what I wanted to represent by taking only the parts of the sentences of the poem I wrote, no matter how you try to organize them, itll end up forming a sentence that does not makes sense.

    <h2>
        Reflection and Future Development
    </h2>
    <p>
        Overall, the project had a good and the expected outcome in the end, despite the multiple changes made over the initial idea. I could practice my skills on communication between softwares, practice that I enjoy doing, especially between a physical and a digital object. As I took inspiration from a letter (physical object) to perform my digital submission, it was an interesting idea linking something physical to control the outcome of a digital one. I was a little unhappy in the end because I could not make use of my string of hair since it is significant for me and gives more meaning to the whole concept of controlling the random poetry through it because for me, that string of hair is or was a part of me, as well a the person who inspired me to make this set of poetry in the first place – it is the connection that exist between me and that significant other. 
In regards of future development I do wish to bring to light the first ideation I had for the project: being able to print a box and attach to it the envelope with the letters I made, attach to it as well a bunch of flowers that eventually will decompose as a nothing lasts forever metaphor and finally, being able to connect the stretch-haired sensor in order for it to modify the random words taken out from the original poem. If completed, this project would certainly be part of an exhibition.
